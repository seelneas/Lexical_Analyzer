## Lexical Analyzer

## Overview

This project implements a simple lexical analyzer (lexer) in C++ for a subset of the C++ programming language. It reads an input statement, categorizes its tokens, and outputs their types, which include keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and symbols.

## Features

Tokenization of C++ statements.

Identification of keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and symbols.

Outputs the categorized tokens in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies Used 

C++

Standard Template Library (STL)

## Getting Started

To use this lexical analyzer, follow the following steps:

## Prerequistes

A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).

Basic knowledge of C++ syntax.

## Installation

Clone the repository

Compile the code

Run the lexical analyzer

## Usage

When prompted, enter a C++ statement.

The analyzer will output the categorized tokens.
